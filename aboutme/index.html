              <p>My name is Betsy and making beautiful, delicious desserts is my passion. It is important to me that my desserts not only look breathtaking but also taste incredible. </p>

              <p>The Blonde Bakeshop is a journey and a passion. I began this journey at a very young age when I learned to cook from my mother. I started with simple cookies and assisted with dinner preparations. Around middle school, I discovered that my heart is in desserts. A few years later, I decided I wanted to make more than just cookies and bars.  I started with decorating cakes and then moved on to more intricate desserts such as Crème Brûlée and Napoleons, learning new techniques through videos.</p>

              <p>I graduated with my B.A. in Business from the University of Dallas, but between classes and studying I could be found baking in my apartment. After graduating from UD, I attended the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, NY for Baking and Pastry Arts, graduating with honors. Between semesters, I worked with well-renowned and award-winning Bakery Lorraine in San Antonio, TX where I am forever grateful for the growth and knowledge I gained from this incredible experience. I also interned with The Rosewood Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas, TX working with some of the most talented pastry chefs in the industry. The opportunities I have had and pastry chefs I have met along my journey have been insurmountable and I will forever be thankful for all of them. </p>

              <p>The Blonde Bakeshop is my way of sharing my passion for desserts and edible art with others. It started as a hobby and has grown into a business. I hope I can help bring your sweet dreams to life! </p>
